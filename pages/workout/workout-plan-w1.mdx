# Workout plan Week 1

<Important>
  For training, I will try to give you clear guidelines and you choose exercises
  that suit your needs as good as possible. Also where you create the highest
  resistance, lower rep ranges are more suitable for bigger muscle groups and
  higher reps ranges for smaller muscle groups.
</Important>

## Exercises

### Exercise 1:

- Warm up progressively increasing weight.
- 3 working sets of 6-10 reps to concentric failure.
- 1 forced rep ONLY on 3rd set
- Rest enough time to fully recover between sets.

### Exercise 2:

- Warm up to test strength and connect to the new movement.
- 3 sets of 6-10 reps to concentric failure.
- 1 Forced rep ONLY on third set.
- Rest enough to fully recover between sets.

### Exercise 3:

Put emphasis on FULL ROM, HOLDING THE CONTRACTION AT THE FULLY LENGTHENED POSITION AND PEAK CONTRACTION FOR 1 SECOND.

Warm up set to test strength and connect to the new movement.

- 3 sets of 8-12 reps
- Not more than 90sec rest and not less than 1 min (for small muscle groups)

### Exercise 4:

Choose an exercise which stimulates the weakest portion of the trained muscle group.

- Warm up set.
- 4 sets of 8-12 reps
- 60 seconds rest for big muscle groups and 45 seconds for small muscle groups.

### Exercise 5:

Isolation Blood work exercise.  
Use the same initial weight for all sets.

- 1 set of 8-12 reps - 1 min rest
- 1 set of 8-12 reps - 45 sec rest
- 1 set of max reps - 30 sec rest
- 1 set of max reps - 15 sec rest
- 1 set of max reps - 5 sec rest
- 1 set of only partial reps if no full rep is possible.

<Important>
  With no rest after this last set (just the time to change weight) reduce the
  weight by 50% and perform an isometric contraction at half way of the movement
  until failure.
</Important>

## Suggested training split for now:

- Chest / Calves
- Back - Traps
- Shoulders
- Rest
- Quads / Glutes
- Biceps / Triceps
- Hamstring / Abs work
- Rest
- Repeat

For calves, glutes and traps you obviously donâ€™t perform as many exercises and sets.

<Important>
  For now **YOU** choose the exercises based on your personal preference and
  knowledge of what feels best.
