# Workout plan Week 2

<Important>
  For training, I will try to give you clear guidelines and you choose exercises
  that suit your needs as good as possible. Also where you create the highest
  resistance, lower rep ranges are more suitable for bigger muscle groups and
  higher reps ranges for smaller muscle groups.
